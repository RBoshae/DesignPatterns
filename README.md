# Design Patterns
A collection of design patterns in modern C++ based on Dmitri Nesteruk Udemy 
course [Design Patterns in Modern C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/).

## Solid Design Principles
- [Single Responsibility Principle](./SolidDesignPrinciples/SingleResponsibilityPrinciple/SingleResponsibility.md)
  - A class should only have one reason to change
  - *Seperation of concerns* - different classes handling different, independent
    taks/problems.
- [Open-Closed Principle](./SolidDesignPrinciples/Open-ClosedPrinciple/Open-ClosedPrinciple.md)
  - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- [Liskov Substitution Principle](./SolidDesignPrinciples/LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple/LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple.md)
  - You should always be able to substitutes a base type for a subtype.
- [Interface Segregation Principle](./SolidDesignPrinciples/LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple/LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple.md)
  - Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces.
  - *YAGNI* - You Ain't Going to Need It. 
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](./SolidDesignPrinciples/DependencyInversionPrinciple/InterfaceSegregationPrinciple.md)
  - High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions.
